# SuperStore-Sales-Analysis-and-Forecasting
This project focuses on delivering a comprehensive data-driven solution for a supermarket's sales strategy using Power BI. It involves four key components: dashboard creation, where KPIs are identified and interactive, visually engaging dashboards are designed; data analysis, providing actionable insights into sales performance through charts and visualizations; sales forecasting, which applies time series analysis to predict sales for the upcoming 15 days; and finally, actionable insights and recommendations, where strategic suggestions are derived to enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall growth. The project aims to empower business decisions through meaningful data interpretation and visualization.
